README for Three.js project - Rotating Cube with Zoom and Mouse Interaction

This repository contains a Three.js project that creates a rotating cube on the web. The cube can zoom in and out on scrolling, and the cube rotates in the same direction as the mouse.

To use this project, you will need to have Three.js installed on your system. You can download Three.js from the official website (https://threejs.org/) or include it via a CDN.

To run the project, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You can interact with the cube in the following ways:

Scrolling: Zoom in and out of the cube using your mouse scroll wheel.
Mouse Interaction: Rotate the cube in the same direction as the mouse. Moving the mouse horizontally or vertically will cause the cube to rotate in the same direction.
The project includes the following files:

index.html: The HTML file containing the code to render the Three.js scene and handle user interaction.
style.css: The CSS file containing styling for the HTML document.
script.js: The JavaScript file containing the Three.js code to create the rotating cube and handle user interaction.
The code includes comments explaining each section of the code, but if you have any questions or run into issues, feel free to open an issue on this repository or contact the project contributors directly.

Enjoy your rotating cube with zoom and mouse interaction!
